/**
 * Editable polls — the question, the options, and each option's reply.
 *
 * Any message that wants a poll names a definition by key; this resolves it and
 * hands back the shape wa_outbound expects. Nothing downstream knows what the
 * options are: the gateway copies them onto the wa_polls row, and when a vote
 * comes back the reply is read from that copy. Adding a new kind of poll is
 * therefore a row in this table, not a deploy.
 *
 * Definitions are seeded on first use, the same way message templates are, so a
 * fresh database is usable without a manual step — and an Ops edit is never
 * overwritten afterwards.
