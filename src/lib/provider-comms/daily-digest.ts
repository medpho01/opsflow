/**
 * The daily provider digest — one WhatsApp message a day, per lab.
 *
 * Every other provider message in this codebase is triggered by a single
 * order: a new order arrives, a confirmation goes unanswered, a deadline is
 * missed. That is the right shape for exceptions and the wrong shape for
 * planning — a lab that has been told about forty orders one at a time still
 * has no picture of its own day.
 *
 * So this is the first message that is about a DAY rather than an order:
 *
 *   Today     what they handled, and what is still open. Sent in the evening,
 *             when the answer is settled and a gap is still fixable.
 *   Tomorrow  the counts, and the actual appointment list. The list is the
 *             point: a count tells a lab how busy tomorrow is, the list tells
 *             them what to staff.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does not do ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not consult the breach engine's quiet hours. Those exist to stop
 * event-driven alerts firing at 03:00, when nobody chose the moment. A digest
 * has a send time an operator picked on purpose, so the send time IS the
 * politeness policy. Honouring quiet hours here would mean a digest scheduled
 * inside them silently never sends — a config that reads as on and does
 * nothing, which is the failure this codebase keeps having to dig out.
 *
 * It does not carry a poll. The confirmation ladder asks a question about one
 * order and maps the answer onto that order's workflow; a digest spans a day
 * and has no workflow to move, so a tap would record a vote with nowhere to
 * go. Providers reply in the group instead, which is where the thread already
 * is.
 *
 * It does not send itself. Like every other provider message it writes a
 * wa_outbound row carrying `groupId`, so the gateway's per-group sendEnabled
 * guard still stands between this and a real provider group.
